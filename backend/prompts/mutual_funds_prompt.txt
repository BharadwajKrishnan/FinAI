</Task>

<Important>
1. SECTION RESTRICTION: ONLY search for and extract mutual funds/ETFs from sections of the document that are specifically labeled as "Mutual Funds", "ETFs", "Mutual Fund Holdings", "ETF Holdings", "Scheme Holdings", or similar mutual fund/ETF sections. DO NOT extract information from stock sections, bank account sections, fixed deposit sections, or any other sections. If the document does not contain a mutual fund/ETF section, return an empty JSON array [].
2. HOW TO IDENTIFY A MUTUAL FUND/ETF: A mutual fund or ETF can be identified by the presence of a NAV (Net Asset Value) property or field. If an investment/asset has a NAV value, it is a mutual fund or ETF. Look for labels like "NAV", "Net Asset Value", "Current NAV", or "NAV per Unit" in the document. If you see NAV mentioned for an investment, treat it as a mutual fund/ETF and extract it.
3. SIP-BASED MUTUAL FUNDS: Note that mutual funds can be SIP-based (Systematic Investment Plan) or lump-sum investments. Both types should be extracted. SIP-based mutual funds are still mutual funds and should be included.
4. DO NOT PERFORM ANY CALCULATIONS WHATSOEVER. ONLY EXTRACT VALUES EXACTLY AS THEY APPEAR IN THE DOCUMENT.
5. ALL VALUES MUST BE EXACTLY AS SHOWN IN THE PDF - NO ROUNDING, NO MODIFICATIONS, NO CALCULATIONS.
6. YOU MUST EXTRACT ALL MUTUAL FUNDS/ETFs FROM THE DOCUMENT - DO NOT SKIP ANY MUTUAL FUND/ETF. EVERY SINGLE MUTUAL FUND/ETF MUST BE INCLUDED.
7. Return the mutual funds/ETFs in a JSON format. Do not include any other text in your response. Only return the JSON.
8. If there are no mutual fund/ETF information in the document, then return an empty JSON array [].
9. Make sure that there are no duplicate mutual funds/ETFs in the JSON list. All the mutual funds/ETFs in the JSON list must be unique.
10. Return ONLY ONE JSON array. Do not repeat or duplicate the JSON array in your response.
</Important>

<Output Format>
Each JSON object MUST have the following keys with EXACT names:
1. "Fund Name" - Extract the name of the mutual fund/ETF EXACTLY as shown in the document
2. "Fund Code" - Extract the mutual fund code/identifier EXACTLY as shown in the document. Look for "Fund Code", "Scheme Code", "ISIN", or "Code" labels. CRITICAL: If you cannot find a fund code in the document for a mutual fund/ETF, DO NOT include that mutual fund/ETF in your response. Only return mutual funds/ETFs that have a fund code clearly visible in the document.
3. "Units" - Extract the number of units held EXACTLY as shown in the document. Look for "Units", "No. of Units", or "Quantity" labels. Extract the EXACT value - do not round, modify, or calculate.
4. "Fund House" - Extract the fund house/AMC (Asset Management Company) name EXACTLY as shown in the document. Look for "Fund House", "AMC", "Asset Management Company", or "Scheme Name" labels.
5. "NAV" - Extract the Net Asset Value per unit EXACTLY as shown in the document. Look for "NAV", "Net Asset Value", or "Current NAV" labels. Extract the EXACT value - do not round, modify, or calculate.
6. "Purchase Date" - Extract the purchase date in YYYY-MM-DD format. Look for "Purchase Date", "Date of Investment", or "Investment Date" labels. If not available, use "1900-01-01" as placeholder.
7. "Value at Cost" - Extract the total amount invested (value at cost) EXACTLY as shown in the document. Look for "Value at Cost", "Amount Invested", "Total Invested", "Investment Amount", or "Purchase Value" labels. Extract the EXACT value as it appears - DO NOT calculate it. DO NOT multiply Units * NAV. The document already shows this value - copy it EXACTLY.
8. "Current Value" - Extract the current market value EXACTLY as shown in the document. Look for "Current Value", "Current Worth", or "Market Value" labels. Extract the EXACT value - do not round, modify, or calculate.
9. "Owner Name" - Primary holder's name. If not provided, use "self"
</Output Format>

<Family Member Details>
The following family members have been added by the user. Use this information to identify which family member each mutual fund/ETF belongs to by matching the account holder name in the document with the names below.
{family_members}

When extracting the "Owner Name" field:
1. Match the account holder name from the document with the family member names listed above (case-insensitive matching)
2. If you find a match, use the exact name as shown in the family members list above
3. If no match is found or the account holder name is not clearly visible in the document, use "self" as the Owner Name
4. The Owner Name should be one of the names from the family members list, or "self" if it's the primary user's account
