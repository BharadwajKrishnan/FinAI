Your task is to extract ONLY stocks/equities (shares of companies) from the document. DO NOT include mutual funds, bonds, or any other investment types. Only extract individual company stocks/equities.

CRITICAL RULES - READ CAREFULLY

1. SECTION RESTRICTION: ONLY search for and extract stocks/equities from sections of the document that are specifically labeled as "Stocks", "Equities", "Stock Holdings", "Equity Portfolio", "Share Holdings", or similar stock/equity sections. DO NOT extract information from mutual fund sections, bank account sections, fixed deposit sections, or any other sections. If the page does not contain a stock/equity section, return an empty JSON array [].
2. DO NOT PERFORM ANY CALCULATIONS WHATSOEVER. ONLY EXTRACT VALUES EXACTLY AS THEY APPEAR IN THE DOCUMENT.
3. ALL VALUES MUST BE EXACTLY AS SHOWN IN THE PDF - NO ROUNDING, NO MODIFICATIONS, NO CALCULATIONS.
4. YOU MUST EXTRACT ALL STOCKS FROM THE PAGE - DO NOT SKIP ANY STOCK. EVERY SINGLE STOCK MUST BE INCLUDED.

Return the stocks/equities in a JSON format. Do not include any other text in your response. Only return the JSON.

Each JSON object MUST have the following keys with EXACT names:
1. "Stock/Equity Name" - REQUIRED - Extract the name EXACTLY as shown in the document
2. "Stock Symbol" - REQUIRED - Extract the ticker symbol EXACTLY as shown (e.g., "AAPL", "RELIANCE", "TCS"). If not available, use the stock name as symbol
3. "Average Price" - REQUIRED - Extract the average purchase price EXACTLY as shown in the document. Look for "Avg. Price", "Average Price", or "Purchase Price" labels. Extract the EXACT value - do not round, modify, or calculate.
4. "Current Price" - REQUIRED - Extract the current market price EXACTLY as shown in the document. Look for "Price", "Current Price", or "Market Price" labels. Extract the EXACT value - do not round, modify, or calculate.
5. "Quantity" - REQUIRED - Extract the quantity EXACTLY as shown in the document. Extract the EXACT value - do not round, modify, or calculate.
6. "Purchase Date" - REQUIRED - Extract purchase date in YYYY-MM-DD format. If not available in document, use "1900-01-01" as placeholder
7. "Value at Cost" - REQUIRED - Extract the total amount invested EXACTLY as shown in the document. Look for "Value at Cost", "Amount Invested", or "Total Invested" labels. Extract the EXACT value as it appears - DO NOT calculate it. DO NOT multiply Average Price * Quantity. The document already shows this value - copy it EXACTLY.
8. "Current Value" - Optional - Extract current market value EXACTLY as shown in the document. Look for "Current Value", "Current Worth", or "Market Value" labels. Extract the EXACT value - do not round, modify, or calculate.
